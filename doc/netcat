# nc for transferring files

On the computer with the file you want to move: 

cat /etc/hosts | nc -l 9999 

On the receiving end: 

nc 192.168.1.100 9999 > etc.hosts 

Of course, you can use the tar trick over nc, arrange the input/output
in different ways, etc, etc, etc. 

e.g., 

tar cvf - some-dir | nc -l 9999 

and 

nc 192.168.1.100 9999 | tar xf -
