# SSH CONFIG

## Add servers to a dotfiles/ssh/config file in the following way:

Host SOME_SHORTCUT 
  Hostname hollowearthradio.org
  User SOME_USERNAME 
  Port SOME_PORT
  
## Setup a symbolic link like so:
ln -s ~/bin/dotfiles/ssh/config.igored  ~/.ssh/config

(Note, config.ignored is what we are ignoring in the .gitignore so this is not in our public repo)
